Static :
1. declared by using keyword static.
2. every instance of class shares same static variables.
3. if changes made to variable. then all the instances of class will see the change.
4. No instance of need to exist in order to access static variable.
        no need to create any reference for class.
5. Uses:- Storing constant values like pi.
          storing counters
          generating unique Id's

6. Static variables are shared between instances.

    class Dog{
    private static String name;
    public Dog(String name)
    this.name= name;
    }
    public void printName()
    {
    sout()
    }
    Dog rex=new Dog('rex');
    Dog fluf=new Dog('fluf');
    rex.printName();        //will print fluf
    fluf.printName();       //will print fluf

    --point 3. once change the static variable, all instances will be changed.


Instance variable:-

1. dont use static keyword when defining.
2. also known as field or member variable.
3. belongs to specific instance of class.
4. every instance can have a diff value.

        Dog rex=new Dog('rex');
        Dog fluf=new Dog('fluf');
        rex.printName();        //will print rex
        fluf.printName();       //will print fluf
