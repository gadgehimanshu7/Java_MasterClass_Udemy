Static :
1. declared by using keyword static.
2. every instance of class shares same static variables.
3. if changes made to variable. then all the instances of class will see the change.
4. No instance of need to exist in order to access static variable.
        no need to create any reference for class.
5. Uses:- Storing constant values like pi.
          storing counters
          generating unique Id's

6. Static variables are shared between instances.

    class Dog{
    private static String name;
    public Dog(String name)
    this.name= name;
    }
    public void printName()
    {
    sout()
    }
    Dog rex=new Dog('rex');
    Dog fluf=new Dog('fluf');
    rex.printName();        //will print fluf
    fluf.printName();       //will print fluf

    --point 3. once change the static variable, all instances will be changed.


Instance variable:-

1. dont use static keyword when defining.
2. also known as field or member variable.
3. belongs to specific instance of class.
4. every instance can have a diff value.

        Dog rex=new Dog('rex');
        Dog fluf=new Dog('fluf');
        rex.printName();        //will print rex
        fluf.printName();       //will print fluf

METHODS----

STATIC METHOD:

1. Stati methods are declared using static modifier.
2. Static methods cant access instance methods and instant variables directly.
3. "this" keyword is current instance of class.
        In static method, we cannot use 'this' keyword.

4. method which doesnot use instance variable, that method declared as static .
    5. 'main' is a static method and is called by jvm, when it starts java application.

        static method are called by 'classname.methodname();' or 'methodname();' if in same class.

        class cal{
            public static void sum(int a , int b){
                println("sum" + (a+b));
            }
        }
        class main{
            p s v m (s args[]){
                cal.sum(4,5);       //method 1 to print static
                printHello();       //method 2 to print static if declared in same class.
            }
            p s v printHello(){     // static method declared in main class.
                s out("Hello");
            }
        }


INSTANCE METHOD:

1. belongs to instance of class.
2. can access insctance method and variables directly as well as static methods and static variables.(no need to use classname or annotation)
3.
